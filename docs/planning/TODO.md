## In Progress

<!-- Tasks currently being worked on -->

## High Priority

<!-- Tasks that should be done soon -->

## Notes

- Tasks are organized by priority
- New tasks spawned from completed work go in "Spawned Tasks"
- Completed tasks move to [DONE.md](DONE.md)
- Each significant task should have a plan document in `../plans/`
- Use format: `### [TASK-XXX] - Task Name` for each task
